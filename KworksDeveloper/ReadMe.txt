From the specification I decided that due to the time constraint I needed to identify the important parts. Developing them first and working down the priority list.
I tried to make my design as adaptable as possible. 

My order of task importance:
Publish/Read articles - main functionality
Login
Styling - thank you bootstrap with added mobile :)
Update/Delete
Likes - was close between comments and this one, but he mentioned in the speak he wants to be able to gauge responses and I feel this will be better and make the important articles seen when combined with the most likes feature.
Most likes

Permission to publish
